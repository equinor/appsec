Both alternatives are viable and provide a good level of security. HTTP(S) assumes the usage of PAT (Personal Access Token) tokens rather than account passwords. A short threat model of the options contains the following sections:</p> Threat SSH (with password-protected keys) HTTPS (with PATs) Interception Encrypted; MITM attack needed. Passphrases protect keys on disk, but not in transit since keys aren't transmitted. Encrypted; susceptible to MITM, but TLS and certificate validation mitigate risks. PATs are used instead of passwords. Impersonation Theft of private key and passphrase required for impersonation. Relies on secure storage of PATs. Impersonation possible if a PAT is exposed. Eavesdropping Encrypted traffic; passphrase adds security at rest, not in transit. Encrypted traffic; PATs should be securely stored to prevent unauthorized access. Authentication Strong, with added layer of passphrase protection for key files. PATs can be set to expire, enhancing security by limiting the lifespan of access credentials. Configuration Requires management of key pairs and passphrases, slightly more complex. Requires management of PATs, including regular rotation and setting appropriate expiration dates. Availability Direct; less prone to web attacks, but firewalls might block SSH. High through standard web ports; PATs can be revoked or expire, requiring renewal for continued access. Key/Token Expiry SSH keys do not expire by default; requires manual rotation for security. PATs can be configured to expire, forcing regular renewal and review of access permissions. Theft of Credentials Risk mitigated by passphrase encryption of the private key. Physical access or malware required to steal. Risk of PAT exposure, especially if stored insecurely or transmitted over insecure channels. Least privilege SSH keys inherit all permissions of a user. No granularity PAT tokens can be configured for fine grained permissions and then provide access to all or only specific repos. This could strengthen security. Token management will add extra complexity. <p>Use SSH with Git</p> <p>We recommend using SSH when Git authenticates and communicates with github.com.

Signed Git commits are an essential security practice which provides a layer of verification that helps mitigate several threats. Some of these threats are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Impersonation: Signed commits use keys to sign the work. By doing so, they certify that the commit was made by the claimed individual. This helps prevent an attacker from impersonating a developer and submitting malicious code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Code tampering: Signing commits ensures the integrity of the code from the time it was committed. If the code is altered in any way after it was signed, the signature will no longer be valid. This helps protect against unauthorized code modifications, which could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Replay attacks: Signed commits can help mitigate replay attacks where an attacker attempts to re-submit a legitimate commit to a different context, potentially causing unintended consequences. The signature verifies not just the content of the commit but also its context within the repository history.</p> </li> <li> <p>Long-term repository integrity: By using signed commits, organizations can ensure the long-term integrity of their codebase. This is crucial for auditing and tracking the provenance of code changes, making it easier to trace back and verify the authenticity of commits over time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Increased trust and compliance: For projects that require strict compliance and governance standards, signed commits provide a mechanism to enforce such policies.

The 3 different methods have their pros and cons.</p> Feature/Aspect SSH Signing GPG Signing S/MIME Signing Basic Mechanism Uses SSH keys for both authentication and signing. Utilizes a public-private key pair specifically for signing. Uses certificates issued by a Certificate Authority (CA). Identity Verification SSH public keys are used to verify the signature. Verification is based on a web of trust or direct key sharing. Relies on certificates verified and issued by trusted CAs. Infrastructure Requires SSH key setup; already needed for repository access. Requires GPG software and management of key pairs. Requires obtaining and managing a certificate from a CA. Potential complex PKI Ease of Setup Simple for users already using SSH keys for Git operations. Can be complex due to key generation, management, and sharing. Varies; obtaining a certificate can be straightforward or complex depending on the provider. Cross-platform Support Broad support across various platforms and Git tools. Well-supported, with widespread integration in Git tools. Support varies; some tools may not support S/MIME directly. Pros - Simplifies workflow by using the same keys for authentication and signing\u2020.  - Integrated into SSH, which is commonly used for secure Git operations. - Decentralized and flexible, with a variety of algorithms and key sizes.  - Well-established in the open-source community. - Trust model is straightforward, based on established CAs.  - May align with existing certificate-based security practices (e.g., email). Cons - Primarily verifies the commit was pushed by an authenticated user, not necessarily the commit's author.  - SSH key management is crucial; compromised keys pose a risk. - Key management and the web of trust model can be complex.  - Requires active key maintenance (revocation, expiration). - Dependent on third-party CAs for issuance and trust.  - Certificates have expiration dates and may incur costs. <p>\u2020 while reusing the SSH key is a recognized advantage of SSH signing, we recommend against this practice, see below.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>We recommend using self-signed SSH keys for signing your git commits (In the future we may switch to a certificate based approach)</p>"},{"location":"guidelines/git-signed-commits/#configure-your-local-development-environment","title":"Configure your local development environment","text":"<p>For this guideline our reference is using Git from the command line. </p> <p>We assume that Git and SSH is installed on your system. </p> <p>We assume that you are using SSH to authenticate Git with github.com.

Thanks to this, we have an overview of all the possible vulnerabilities in our projects,\u201d Petter Moe Kvalvaag says.</p> <p>How each team uses the tool in their daily work is up to them to decide, but the most common approach is to tell the tool where your code and GitHub repo is.</p>  \u201cSnyk will automatically and continuously scan your code and give you a overview of your status; how many vulnerabilities you have, what they are and what you need to do. Snyk can make a developer's life much easier and can even create pull requests automatically for you.\u201d          - Petter Moe Kvalvaag      <p>Together with Ipsita, Petter has been running onboarding sessions and workshops to help spread the word of Snyk to the developer community. They\u2019 also spent time working on a backend solution to Snyk that will help give us even better reporting capabilities.</p> <p>\u201cSince Snyk itself has limited reporting capabilities, we\u2019ve had to make our own way around it. We\u2019ve used their API, imported vulnerability data into our own database and created visualizations based on this,\u201d Petter explains.</p> Petter works with vulnerability management as part of the AppSec-team. Benjamin focuses on threat modelling. <p>But why bother with a workaround to visualize data, you might ask? To be able to take an analytical approach and see a bigger picture \u2013 of course!</p> <p>\u201cThis could let us see that many different teams are facing the same problem, for example vulnerabilities with Docker Images. We could then help the teams find each other to discuss their problems, but we could also target this issue specifically and provide workshops or training to help solve it. This means we can help the community as a whole,\u201d Petter says.</p>  \u201cGetting to work with taking an analytical and data-driven approach to the work is really interesting \u2013 and very motivating. Not only are we able to find potential problems, but we can also use the data to see if what we did helped or not.\u201d  - Petter Moe Kvalvaag   <p>\u201cOnce we have identified an issue and launched an initiative to mitigate it, we're able to see in retrospect how effective our initiative was. This helps us find the most effective way to reach out and assist the teams in the future,\u201d Ipsita explains.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"resources/stories/meet_the_appsec_team/#why-you-should-prepare-for-an-attack","title":"Why you should prepare for an attack","text":"<p>Knowing what weaknesses you have is one thing, but you should also plan for someone to exploit them right from the start. Welcome to the world of threat modeling. Simply put, it means identifying and discussing the possible threats and weaknesses to your system.</p>  \u201cThere are many different methods to do threat modeling, but what they all have in common is that you draw up a diagram of your system. Then, you use this to think of ways that someone could attack your system \u2013 and how to prevent or deal with it. You need to think like an attacker to identify your weaknesses. It\u2019s a big clich\u00e9 but it\u2019s incredibly efficient.\u201d          - Benjamin L\u00f8kling Randeberg        <p>The team even hosted a threat modeling workshop at EDC 2022, which acts as the foundation for future workshops for threat modeling. So far, they\u2019ve introduced several teams to the concept and are hoping to add even more in the future.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re hosting an in-person workshop, but we\u2019re also following up on the teams in the months after their introduction. This makes sure we can help them with any questions, build upon anything they find and help them become even more secure \u2013 based on their team\u2019s context. We really hope threat modeling is something people will adapt, because it\u2019s such a great tool to have,\u201d Benjamin explains.</p> What kind of team would the AppSec team be without their own merch?

You also get to understand and explore the bigger picture:</p>      \u201cWorking in security means not only do you get to learn how everything works, but you also get to think about how someone could exploit things. Together, you get an all-round view of what you can do with different things. It\u2019s not just software either, it\u2019s hardware or gadgets too. This combination is what makes it so incredibly interesting. You get to do new things every day and learn new things every day.\u201d      - Ipsita Mishra   <p>You\u2019ll get to learn a lot, but you\u2019ll also get to be a teacher in order to spread the good word of application security \u2013 for example at internal conferences and workshops.

Given the complexity of this landscape, using automated tools quickly becomes a requirement to keep software patched and secure.</p> <p>So what can we do to mitigate this risk? The current strategy in Equinor is to automatically scan the projects using tools like Snyk. These tools can scan code repositories continuously and on every pull request. They will find your Dockerfiles, npm package-locks, pip requirements and many other packaging formats and check if you are currently installing a dependency with an associated known vulnerability.

The recommendation is thus to either fix all issues or ignoring them - for a period of time or permanently - to show that the they have been evalutated and addressed.</p> <p>The Snyk Priority Score is a good reference when prioritizing Snyk findings, and should be taken into consideration. Be mindful that Snyk reports on potential vulnerabilities, so you will still need to investigate if the reported issue is a true positive or not.</p> <p>For issues with a fix available, you can trigger Snyk to create a pull-request which addresses the issue. The fix usually involves upgrading the dependency to a vulnerability free version or with a patch. This upgrade might break the code and Snyk will indicate this in the pull-request created. The reviewer is responsible to ensure that the changes in the PR won't cause issues with the project.  </p> <p>In most languages, a minor (1.1.x \u2192 1.2.x) or patch (1.1.1 \u2192 1.1.2) release is considered \u201cnon-breaking\u201d. Whilst a major version (1.x.x \u2192 2.x.x) contains breaking changes.</p> <p>For issues with no fix available it is up to the developers to evaluate how to handle this - whether it be explicitly ignoring the issue until a fix is available, replacing the dependency, or removing the dependency all together as you discover it is not really needed. An important thing here is that an action has been taken and that the issue does not remain \"unhandled\".</p> <p>On a side-note: It is a good practice to define Security Requirements for your applications.
