Both alternatives are viable and provide a good level of security. HTTP(S) assumes the usage of PAT (Personal Access Token) tokens rather than account passwords. A short threat model of the options contains the following sections:</p> Threat SSH (with password-protected keys) HTTPS (with PATs) Interception Encrypted; MITM attack needed. Passphrases protect keys on disk, but not in transit since keys aren't transmitted. Encrypted; susceptible to MITM, but TLS and certificate validation mitigate risks. PATs are used instead of passwords. Impersonation Theft of private key and passphrase required for impersonation. Relies on secure storage of PATs. Impersonation possible if a PAT is exposed. Eavesdropping Encrypted traffic; passphrase adds security at rest, not in transit. Encrypted traffic; PATs should be securely stored to prevent unauthorized access. Authentication Strong, with added layer of passphrase protection for key files. PATs can be set to expire, enhancing security by limiting the lifespan of access credentials. Configuration Requires management of key pairs and passphrases, slightly more complex. Requires management of PATs, including regular rotation and setting appropriate expiration dates. Availability Direct; less prone to web attacks, but firewalls might block SSH. High through standard web ports; PATs can be revoked or expire, requiring renewal for continued access. Key/Token Expiry SSH keys do not expire by default; requires manual rotation for security. PATs can be configured to expire, forcing regular renewal and review of access permissions. Theft of Credentials Risk mitigated by passphrase encryption of the private key. Physical access or malware required to steal. Risk of PAT exposure, especially if stored insecurely or transmitted over insecure channels. Least privilege SSH keys inherit all permissions of a user. No granularity PAT tokens can be configured for fine grained permissions and then provide access to all or only specific repos. This could strengthen security. Token management will add extra complexity. <p>Use SSH with Git</p> <p>We recommend using SSH when Git authenticates and communicates with github.com.

Signed Git commits are an essential security practice which provides a layer of verification that helps mitigate several threats. Some of these threats are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Impersonation: Signed commits use keys to sign the work. By doing so, they certify that the commit was made by the claimed individual. This helps prevent an attacker from impersonating a developer and submitting malicious code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Code tampering: Signing commits ensures the integrity of the code from the time it was committed. If the code is altered in any way after it was signed, the signature will no longer be valid. This helps protect against unauthorized code modifications, which could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Replay attacks: Signed commits can help mitigate replay attacks where an attacker attempts to re-submit a legitimate commit to a different context, potentially causing unintended consequences. The signature verifies not just the content of the commit but also its context within the repository history.</p> </li> <li> <p>Long-term repository integrity: By using signed commits, organizations can ensure the long-term integrity of their codebase. This is crucial for auditing and tracking the provenance of code changes, making it easier to trace back and verify the authenticity of commits over time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Increased trust and compliance: For projects that require strict compliance and governance standards, signed commits provide a mechanism to enforce these policies. They increase trust among contributors and users by ensuring that all changes are authenticated and authorized by the rightful committers.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"guidelines/git-signed-commits/#tldr","title":"TLDR;","text":"<ul> <li>Sign all your Git commits</li> <li>Use SSH, with a passphrase protected private key, to sign your Git commits</li> <li>Use separate SSH keys for signing and authentication</li> <li>Use branch protection and required signed Git commits</li> </ul>"},{"location":"guidelines/git-signed-commits/#signing-methods","title":"Signing methods","text":"<p>The official github documentation on signature verification shows that commits can be signed using GPG, SSH or S/MIME. The 3 different methods have their pros and cons.</p> Feature/Aspect SSH Signing GPG Signing S/MIME Signing Basic Mechanism Uses SSH keys for both authentication and signing. Utilizes a public-private key pair specifically for signing. Uses certificates issued by a Certificate Authority (CA). Identity Verification SSH public keys are used to verify the signature. Verification is based on a web of trust or direct key sharing. Relies on certificates verified and issued by trusted CAs. Infrastructure Requires SSH key setup; already needed for repository access. Requires GPG software and management of key pairs. Requires obtaining and managing a certificate from a CA. Potential complex PKI Ease of Setup Simple for users already using SSH keys for Git operations. Can be complex due to key generation, management, and sharing. Varies; obtaining a certificate can be straightforward or complex depending on the provider. Cross-platform Support Broad support across various platforms and Git tools. Well-supported, with widespread integration in Git tools. Support varies; some tools may not support S/MIME directly. Pros - Simplifies workflow by using the same keys for authentication and signing.  - Integrated into SSH, which is commonly used for secure Git operations. - Decentralized and flexible, with a variety of algorithms and key sizes.  - Well-established in the open-source community. - Trust model is straightforward, based on established CAs.  - May align with existing certificate-based security practices (e.g., email). Cons - Primarily verifies the commit was pushed by an authenticated user, not necessarily the commit's author.  - SSH key management is crucial; compromised keys pose a risk. - Key management and the web of trust model can be complex.  - Requires active key maintenance (revocation, expiration). - Dependent on third-party CAs for issuance and trust.  - Certificates have expiration dates and may incur costs. <p>Note</p> <p>We recommend using self-signed SSH keys for signing your git commits (In the future we may switch to a certificate based approach)</p>"},{"location":"guidelines/git-signed-commits/#configure-your-local-development-environment","title":"Configure your local development environment","text":"<p>For this guideline our reference is using Git from the command line. </p> <p>We assume that Git and SSH is installed on your system. </p> <p>We assume that you are using SSH to authenticate Git with github.com.

Now, most of our developer teams are smaller units with a few members. It falls to these very members to handle all aspects of development from frontend to backend \u2013 and everything else.

It is not possible to read and understand this code, and as such this becomes a legitimate application security risk. An example is the recent supply chain attack through <code>colors.js</code>, where the maintainer simply added an infinite loop in the code resulting in a Denial of Service to any Node.js server using it.</p> <p>This is a strong argument for pinning packages to exact versions as provisioned in e.g. npm lock files, but the counter side of that is that you need to explicitly upgrade to get the latest security patches. Given the complexity of this landscape, using automated tools quickly becomes a requirement to keep software patched and secure.</p> <p>So what can we do to mitigate this risk? The current strategy in Equinor is to automatically scan the projects using tools like Snyk. These tools can scan code repositories continuously and on every pull request. They will find your Dockerfiles, npm package-locks, pip requirements and many other packaging formats and check if you are currently installing a dependency with an associated known vulnerability.
