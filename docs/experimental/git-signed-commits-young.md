# 🔥 Yo, Code Warriors! 🧑‍💻 Let's Get Sigma with Signed Commits! 🦸‍♂️

Alright, fam, it's time to level up your coding game and flex those sigma vibes. 💪 You know, being that lone wolf 🐺 who's got everything under control without breaking a sweat. Let's dive into why signing your commits is the ultimate sigma move and how to do it. 🚀

## Why Signing Your Commits is Pure Sigma Energy  

- **🕵️‍♂️ Identity Flex (No Impostors Allowed)**  
  Signing your commits is like stamping your unique seal of approval. It confirms that *you* made the changes, blocking any wannabe impostors from sneaking in malicious code.  

- **🔒 Code Integrity = Sigma Grindset**  
  A signed commit ensures your code remains untouched from the moment you commit. If anyone tries to mess with it afterward, the signature breaks, throwing up red flags.  

- **🚫🔁 No Replay Shenanigans (Stay Ahead of the Game)**  
  Signed commits stop attackers from reusing your legit commits in shady contexts, maintaining the flow and context of your code history.  

- **🕵️‍♂️ Audit Like a Boss (Keep It 100)**  
  With signed commits, tracking changes becomes a breeze, making audits smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy.  

- **🌟 Boosting Street Cred (Trust & Compliance)**  
  For projects with strict standards, signed commits show you're playing by the rules, building trust among your crew and users.

## How to Sign Your Commits and Embrace the Sigma Lifestyle  

### 🛠️ Step 1: Generate Your SSH Key  
Fire up your terminal and punch in:  

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/git_ssh_signing_key_1 -C "Created on $(date), for $(whoami) on github.com" 
```

This crafts a fresh SSH key for signing.

💡 **Pro tip**: Add a passphrase. Don’t be that person who skips security.  

### 🛠️ Step 2: Add Your Key to the SSH Agent 🤖  

Alright, so you've got your **fancy new SSH key**, but let's be real—typing your passphrase every time? That's **LAME.** Ain't nobody got time for that.  

So let’s make your system remember your key like a **goldfish with a 500 IQ** 🧠🐠:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/git_ssh_signing_key_1
```
Now your key is locked in 🔐, and you can commit like an absolute **Chad** without re-entering your passphrase every 2 seconds.

Big W. ✅

### 🏴‍☠️ Step 3: Tell Git to Use Your New Key  

Yo, **Git ain't psychic**—you gotta tell it to start using that **top-tier** SSH key.  

Hit it with this:  

```bash
git config --global gpg.format ssh
git config --global user.signingkey ~/.ssh/git_ssh_signing_key_1.pub
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```
This is like **giving Git a treasure map** 🏴‍☠️ so it knows where to find your key.

Now every commit is gonna be signed like a **true security giga-brain.** 🔥

### 🔑 Step 4: Drop That Key into GitHub (Gotta Let the Squad Know)  

Your key is ready, but **GitHub doesn’t know you like that yet.**  

So let’s make it official:  

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/git_ssh_signing_key_1.pub
```

☝️ This command will **spit out your public key**. Copy that **beautiful string of characters** ✨ and:

🔗 **Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key**

💾 Paste it in and save! **BOOM**. Now GitHub recognizes you like an old friend. 😎

### 🚧 Step 5: Protect Your Branches (Gatekeeping, But in a Good Way)  

Alright, **now we set up branch protection** to make sure NO UNSIGNED COMMITS GET IN. ❌🔓  

This is like **putting a bouncer** in front of your code, checking IDs before letting commits into the club. 🕶️💪  

Set up **branch protection rules** so **ONLY signed commits** get through.

No signature? 🚫 **Access DENIED.**  

### 🏆 Final Boss Move: Always Sign, Always Secure  

Using signed commits isn’t just *cool*, it’s **mandatory** if you wanna keep your code safe.  

Don’t be that dev who gets caught slipping—sign those commits and keep your repo locked down.  

💯 **Secure devs are W devs. Now go sign those commits.** 🚀🔥
