## What this means for you?

**Unified Platform:** Code and code security will now be managed under the same platform, eliminating the need for a separate dashboard.

**Container Scanning**: Please note that GHAS does not currently offer container scanning solutions, we have explored other alternatives like Trivy so please reach out if you have any questions.

**GHAS Features**: We encourage you to enable additional GHAS features like code scanning with CodeQL
