## What this means for you?

**Unified Platform:** Code and code security will now be managed under the same platform, eliminating the need for a separate dashboard.

**Current Usage**: We will continue using Snyk until our licenses expire, so please keep utilizing the platform during this transition.

**Overlap Period**: In October, we’ll have a month where both Snyk and GHAS will be in use to ensure a smooth transition.

**Container Scanning**: Please note that GHAS does not currently offer container scanning solutions, we have explored other alternatives like Trivy so please reach out if you have any questions.

**GHAS Features**: We encourage you to enable GHAS features like secret scanning, Dependabot, and CodeQL in your public repositories. These features are free for open-source projects, so take advantage of them!
