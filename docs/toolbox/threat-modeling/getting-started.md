# Getting Started

Regardless of methodology, all threat modeling revolves around four questions:

1. **What are we working on?**
2. **What can go wrong?**
3. **What are we going to do about it?**
4. **Did we do a good enough job?**

There is no shortage of excellent resources on how to work through these questions in practice. Rather than repeating what others have already written well, here are some we recommend:

- [Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/) - A good starting point if you want to understand the values and principles behind threat modeling
- [Agile Threat Modelling](https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-threat-modelling.html) - If you want a concrete walkthrough of how to run a threat modeling session
- [Shostack's Four Question Framework](https://shostack.org/resources/threat-modeling) - If you want to go deeper on the four questions and the thinking behind them

## When to threat model

The short answer: early and often.

- **New systems or services** - Before you start building, not after
- **Significant changes** - New integrations, architecture changes, new data flows
- **Regularly** - As part of your development lifecycle, not just at project kickoff

Threat modeling does not have to be a big event. Even a short, focused session with the right people can surface critical issues that would otherwise go unnoticed.

## Who should be involved?

Threat modeling works best as a team activity. The people who build and operate the system are the ones who understand it best. Involve anyone who can contribute to answering the four questions above.
