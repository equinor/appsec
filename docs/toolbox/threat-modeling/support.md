!!! warning "Facilitation on pause"
    The AppSec team currently has a pause on facilitating threat modeling sessions.

Here are some ways to get started on your own:

- **AppSec community on Slack** - The best place to ask questions, share experiences, and get feedback from others who have done this before
- **Security Champions network** - Your team's Security Champion is a great first point of contact
- **Self-service** - The resources on the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) page give you everything you need to run your first session
