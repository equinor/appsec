# Belts and Activity system

We are launching a new activity system, previously only available to the [learning platform](./4-learning-platform.md) users, now for **the whole Security Champions Network**!

## This is how it works

### Secure Code learning platform

!!! Info "If you are using the Secure Code learning platform"
    Nothing changes except where you register activities! It pays to learn, and you get to upskill your knowledge as well, Win Win!

There are 5 belts you can achieve.```White```, ```Yellow```, and ```Green``` belt are achievable from only learning through the platform. More on the merch you can get from the different belts [here](./6-merch.md#merch-for-belts). The ```brown``` and ```black``` belts are something special. They require you to complete activities that give back to the Security Champion network.

!!! Danger " "
    The ```brown``` and ```black``` belts are special and require you to complete activities normally in the Security Champion network. Check them out below!

- To start earning the ```brown``` belt: Complete the three belts from the learning platform (```white```, ```yellow```, and ```green```)
- To gain the ```brown``` belt: Complete ```3``` activities from the list [below](./5-belts-and-activities.md#activities)
- To gain the ```black``` belt: Complete ```6``` new activities, for a total of ```9```

### Others

If you are not taking a part of the Secure Code learning platform, you need to do activities all the way. We want to promote the [learning platform](./4-learning-platform.md), so you should really test out the hands-on lessons!
Each belt requires X amount of approved activities.

#### Activities per belt

|White|Yellow|Green|Brown|Black|**Total**|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1|2|3|4|5|**15**|

Ex: Yellow is ```3``` completed activities, ```1``` for ```white```, ```2``` for ```yellow```

### Registration
