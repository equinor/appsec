## Belt system

We are launching a new belt system with this learning platform. There are 5 belts you can achieve, where ```White```, ```Yellow```, and ```Green``` belt are achievable from only learning through the platform. More on the merch you can get from the different belts [here](./5-merch.md#merch-for-belts). The ```brown``` and ```black``` belts are something special. They require you to complete activities that give back to the Security Champion network.

!!! Danger " "
    The ```brown``` and ```black``` belts are special and require you to complete activities normally in the Security Champion network.

- In order to start earning the brown belt, you need to have completed the three belts from the learning platform (```white```, ```yellow```, and ```green```).
- In order to gain the ```brown``` belt, you need to complete 3 activities from the list below. To achieve the ```black``` belt, you need to complete 6 new activities, for a total of 9.

You report this by using the "Champion passport", add your activity, select ```1``` in hour slot, and comment on what you did, and when you did it. We will then go through and double-check the activity, and if everything is A-OK, you get the activity successfully registered!
