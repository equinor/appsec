## Morning coffee :coffee:

Informal chat around application security topics, it's a great place to ask questions and start discussions. It happens every Wednesday from 10:00 to 10:30. You can also propose topics in advace in the [#security-champion](https://equinor.slack.com/archives/C036HGPBJ04) channel on Slack.

## Security Champion Seminar

On the last Thursday of every month, from 12.00 to 13.00, we host the Security Champion Seminar. The seminar typically includes talks from members of the Security Champion network and/or the Application Security team.
