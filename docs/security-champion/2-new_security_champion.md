# Onboarding for new Security Champions

## Welcome young padawan

Now that you've signed up for Equinor's Security Champion environment, I bet you're wondering what you've gotten your self in to?
If you haven't had a onboarding meeting since you joined, please request one in the Security Champion slack channel! We hope to get everyone automagically invited, but mistakes can happen.

## Expectations

Security is _everyone's_ responsibility! You as a Security Champion are a voice for security. Your role is to bring security on the agenda within your team, helping the "shift left security" mentality.

The Security Champions environment is a community made up of people interested in security where the _people_ are in the center. You and your experiences will drive this community, and we will rely on you to participate in discussions, activities and ask questions. Don't worry, we won't bite!

## What you get

- You get to take part in a community of like minded people
- There will be activities only catered to Security Champions, which can be used to improve your knowledge regarding security. This will hopefully ignite that security spark within you
- You will help form this community, as your voice and your experiences matter
- You will also get experiences and knowledge that might help advance your career
- Last but not least: Awesome merch!

## Learning platform

We are testing out a secure coding learning platform. You as a champion is a perfect match, and that is why you get special merch by learning!

### What can you expect?

- Learning about security and secure coding in "hands on" sessions in a sandbox environment
- View video lessons
- Gain unique merch based off your belt level!
- Contribute to the SCN
- Have fun!
- Bragging rights
- Learn things that may help advance your career!

There is a wide arrangement of subjects, and you can do them all if you wish!
So there are tracks for:

- Data Scientist
- OWASP Mobile top 10 (ios/android)
- OWASP API top 10

Use [this forms](https://forms.microsoft.com/e/7BTkd7gGJT) to sign up for it! Happy learning!

### Belt system

We are launching a new belt system with this learning platform.
There are 5 belts you can achieve, where White, Yellow and Green belt is achievable from only learning through the platform. More on the merch you can get from the different belts [here](#merch).
The brown and black belts are something special. They require you to complete activities normally in the Security Champion network.

- In order to start earning the brown belt, you need to have completed the three belts from the learning platform (white, yellow and green).
- In order to gain the brown belt, you need to complete 3 activities from the list below. In order to achieve the black belt, you need to complete 6 new activities, for a total of 9.

You report this by using the "Champion passport", add your activity, select "1" in hour slot and comment on what you did, when you did it. We will then go through and double check the activity and if everything is A-OK, you get the activity successfully registered!

## Merch

As SCN age, we will have different merch come and go. Below we have a record of some of the selection we have given out. Some of them are out of stock, some are in stock, you never know! Should we get someone to do inventory? Probably...

- Stickers: A large assortment of stickers to help show that you are the voice of security! With the amount of stickers we have, you will get a proper workout while carrying your laptop?
- Hoodie: You act the part? Great! The only thing lacking is dressing for the part!
- Socks: Socks decorated with The Security Champion shields! Would they have protected Achilles? Maybe not. Will they protect you from cyber criminals? Who knows! But you will certainly look stylish while being hacked!
- Book (Alice and Bob Learn Application Security): Complete the challenge at [this form](https://forms.microsoft.com/r/cLRPzRtPGQ)
- AbbSack: You have to see it to believe it! Keep your items _secure_ while traveling
- Lanyard: Decorate your neck with shields to ward off evil _phishing_ attacks. It even holds your card!
- Pins: Decorate your lanyard or clothes with shields to further increase your _phishing_ protection
- Christmas ornament: No christmas is secure without your own Security Champion christmas tree ornament
- S.W.A.T. (Small Work Addictive Thing), the latest and freshest within fidget toys. Meetings will never be the same!

To get these items, you can find out where the AppSec office is, social engineer your way in to the building, find our seats and ask for one or more of the items.

You can get in touch with the team when we do stands and events.
