# Merchandise

Merch is an important tool in building a security culture. We need to be visible, both the AppSec team and our champions to raise awareness to security. We also want to make being a Security Champion something to be proud of, and we are leveraging merch as one of the tools in order to manage this.

As SCN age, we will have different merch come and go. Below we have a record of some of the selections we have given out. Some of them are out of stock, some are in stock, you never know! Should we get keep inventory? Probably...

- ```Stickers```: A large assortment of stickers to help show that you are the voice of security! With the number of stickers we have, you will get a proper workout while carrying your laptop
- ```Black Hoodie```: Display your black belt to everyone in the vicinity. You are a true champion
- ```Socks```: Socks decorated with The Security Champion shields! Would they have protected Achilles? Maybe not. Will they protect you from cyber criminals? Who knows! But you will certainly look stylish while being hacked!
- ```Book (Alice and Bob Learn Application Security)```: Complete the challenge at [this form](https://forms.microsoft.com/r/cLRPzRtPGQ)
- ```AbbSack```: You have to see it to believe it! Keep your items _secure_ while traveling
- ```BallSec```: Those pesky attackers are giving you a lot of stress? Relieve it with your branded stress ball!
- ```Lanyard```: Start your belt journey to black belt here with a stylish card holder
- ```Pins```: Decorate your lanyard to display your belt level to the world
- ```Christmas ornament```: No Christmas tree is secure without your own Security Champion Christmas tree ornament. Is it because the christmas tree is offline? Most likely
- ```S.W.A.T. (Small Work Addictive Thing)```: the latest and freshest within fidget toy technology. Meetings will never be the same! This exists in multiple colors. Gotta cath'em all!

## Merch for belts

Since we are launching a new belt system connected to the secure coding platform, we need fresh merch! Below is a list of what you can get at the different belt systems. The items will be shipped via mail unless you can pick it up in the building (Stavanger Forus Ã˜st).

- ```White``` belt:
    - Your very own white lanyard decorated with placeholders for those hard-earned pins.
- ```Yellow``` belt:
    - A yellow pin to hang on your newly acquired lanyard. Be proud!
    - A yellow S.W.A.T. to showcase your advancement within security. It will be your best friend in meetings.
- ```Green``` belt:
    - A green pin to display your advanced knowledge of secure coding.
- ```Brown``` belt:
    - A brown pin to show that you are no rookie in terms of being one of the top-notch champions in our network.
    - A brown S.W.A.T. that will become your best friend when focusing.
- ```Black``` belt:
    - A black pin. Your final step to look like an overly decorated army general. You can retire happy as your life-long goal of contributing to Equinor's Security Champion Network is finally complete _for now_.
    - Hoodie: Now that you are all medal'ed out, the last thing you need is that sweet warm hacker hoodie to put the . over the i.

!!! note
    Merch will "build up" and be shipped in bulk, normally every 2/3 belt levels in order to avoid too much shipping work.
