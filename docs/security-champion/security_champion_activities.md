# Security Champion Example Activities 🦸‍♀️

## Ensure that all your code is being scanned by SAST

Ensure all your projects code is scanned by a SAST (ex. by Snyk) + and all developers are using a linter

## Define [security requirements](../resources/security_requirements.md)

Have a look at our [security requirements](../resources/security_requirements.md)-page and define some for your project.

## Threat Modelling activities

- Facilitate a [threat modelling session](../resources/threat_modelling.md) with your team - looking at the high level architecture of your system(s)
- Introduce "Abuser stories" for all your tasks (ex add it some template you are using for detailing tasks)

## Have the team work through the OWASP Juice Shop

[OWASP JuiceShop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop) is a great resource for security training and getting familiar with OWASP Top Ten. There are many ways to utilize this project for training, with some of them being:

- Run it in CTF-mode, and agree on what challenges are to be solved during this sprint. At the end of the sprint, go through the challenges
- Set aside a couple of days for going through the challenges together
- Go though one challenge each stand-up

## Check out the OWASP ASVS

[OWASP ASVS](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) is a collection of web application technical security controls and requirements. Have a look and see if this makes sense to use for your project :)

## Manually security test your application

Have a look at [WSTG](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)
