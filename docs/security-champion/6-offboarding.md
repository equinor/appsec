# Offboarding for Security Champions

## Sad to see you go

We are all busy people in a busy time. If you feel the need to leave the Security Champion Network, then it's all good. Circumstances change, and you are free to use [this offboarding form](https://forms.microsoft.com/e/grBttpH6A4) to automagically leave.

If you have someone that is interested in taking over the role for you, please point them to the champions onboarding section.

Though you may leave the network, we hope the learnings from the network stay with you forever. You are always welcome back at a later time!
