# About the network

The Security Champion Network is intended to be a community for Security Champions in Equinor. Software development over the last years has rapidly evolved from big development teams consisting of dozens of developers to smaller autonomous teams where we are today. With greater responsibility of the whole lifecycle of applications, modern DevOps teams are also expected to handle security.

This network was born to facilitate security awareness and competence building in DevOps teams. These are necessary ingredients for successfully [_shifting security left_](https://snyk.io/learn/shift-left-security/). It is a place where teams can safely exchange experiences - _both good and bad_, and hopefully learn from each others. The end goal is for the Security Champion Network to become Equinor's powerhouse for application security.

## Desired outcome

Create a lively community for people working with Application Security in Equinor. Knowledge is shared across teams, and we are then able to scale security in a more impactful way.

## Activities

Please check our [event](./events/index.md) site for info about upcoming and past Security Champion network events.

The main communication channel for the community is [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T02JL00JU/CMM6FSW5V). This is where people can post questions exchange experiences when it comes to different tools and technologies etc.

## Role of the AppSec team

The Security Champions Network is run by the AppSec team, but we aim to empower our champions to contribute in any way they can.
